    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>

            1/2 onion, quartered
            </li>
        <li>

            1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and olive oil
            </li>
        <li>

            2 teaspoons butter
            </li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Roughly quarter the onion half, and separate the pieces. 
            Place onion pieces on a baking tray. 
            Open the can of diced tomatoes. Carefully drizzle some 
            of the liquid onto the onion. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Roast onions in the preheated oven until soft, 
            about 25 minutes. Place onions and tomatoes in a 
            high-powered blender. Cover tightly and blend on 
            high for 40 seconds. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Carefully 
            pour in the tomato mixture, and cook, stirring 
            occasionally until hot, about 3 minutes. Stir in 3 
            tablespoons cream. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Ladle soup into bowls, and drizzle remaining cream 
            over each serving. 
        </li>
  
    </ol>
